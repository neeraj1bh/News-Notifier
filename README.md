# News Notifier
[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/) [![Open Source Love svg1](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

A Python application that scrapes the RSS Feeds of a website and
pops up notification of top news for the day according to the interval (in
seconds) you specified.


Requirements
============

This script has been developed in Python 3.8, so you'll need python3.

As this script uses various python packages, I've created a requirement file so
that you just have to type:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This will find and install the needed packages

Usage
=====

After installing all the requirements run latest_news.py and then enter the interval (in seconds) of news notification.
