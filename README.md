Description
===========

A Python script that pops up notification of top news.

Requirements
============

This script has been developed in Python 3.8, so you'll need python3.

As this script uses various python packages, I've created a requirement file so
that you just have to type:

```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This will find and install the needed packages
